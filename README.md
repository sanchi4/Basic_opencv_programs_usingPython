# Basic_opencv_programs_usingPython

These are three basic programs written in python using opencv.

<b>FACE DETECTION</b> - It will detect all the faces that are visible in the image. The program uses the library  haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

<b>COLOR DETECTION</b>- It will recognize red, blue and yellow color in the picture and will point out the respective colors in the image.

<b>SHAPE DETECTION </b>- It will recognize circles, rectangles, hexagon, pentagon in the picture and display some text accordingly.



<b>To run the application you need to have python and opencv. Following are the steps to use opencv with python-</b>

1)  First install Python 2.7. Leave all settings as default. In that case, Python will be installed in default folder C:\Python27\

2) Now install Numpy. Again leave everything default. Numpy will find Python directory and will be installed to most appropriate folder.

3) Now double-click OpenCV.exe. It will ask for extraction folder. Give it as just C:\. It will extract all files to C:\opencv\  . Wait until everything is extracted.


4) Now copy everything in the folder C:\opencv\build\python\x86\2.7\ ( most probably, there will be only one file cv2.pyd ) and paste it in the folder C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\
